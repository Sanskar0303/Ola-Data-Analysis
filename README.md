# Ola-Data-Analysis

This project provides a detailed analysis of OLA ride data, based on a dataset of around 20,000 records. Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that offer insights into key aspects of the business:

1. **Overall:** Tracks ride volume trends and booking status breakdowns to understand demand and success rates.
2. **Vehicle Type:** Highlights the top 5 vehicle types by total distance traveled.
3. **Revenue:** Examines revenue distribution by payment methods, identifies top customers, and shows daily ride distance patterns.
4. **Cancellation:** Breaks down ride cancellations by customer and driver reasons to pinpoint challenges.
5. **Ratings:** Displays driver and customer ratings across vehicle categories to assess service quality.

These visualizations help reveal important patterns in operations, customer behavior, and revenue, supporting informed decision-making for improving ride services.
